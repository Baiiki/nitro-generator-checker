# Nitro-generator-checker


To start with, we need to install all the necessary modules for generate and checks nitros.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```


**IF YOU USE A WEBHOOK DISCORD, DO THIS! OTHERWISE, DON'T DO IT!**
The next step is to create a discord webhooks on any server. It is with this webhooks that all valid nitros will be written in the channel.
You will have to create a webhook and copy the link. You will have to launch the `main.py` and then paste the webhook when you are asked.


Just run `main.py`, specify the number of nitros you want to generate and check, then just wait
